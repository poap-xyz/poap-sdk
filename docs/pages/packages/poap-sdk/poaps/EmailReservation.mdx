# Email Reservation

A POAP can be reserved with an email where to receive the instructions to mint
it to the blockchain in the future. The email could not be sent in cases
that another email is sent in their place or the collector knows already how to
mint it afterwards.

```typescript
import { POAPReservation } from '@poap-xyz/poap-sdk/poaps';

const emailReservation: POAPReservation = await client.emailReservation({
  mintCode: 'your_poap_code',
  email: 'your@email.io',
  sendEmail: true,
});
```

This method can throw [custom errors](Errors) that need to handled.
